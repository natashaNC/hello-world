About Me: Creative and logical thinking;  an extensive background in administration, project management, and entrepreneurship, now entering the tech sector; myriad eclectic interests.

A lifelong learner, multifaceted, and dynamic. Passionate about living life, I’ve studied foreign languages, love cooking /creating recipes intuitively. I’m looking forward to traveling more, studying art / design / sewing / more creative outlets, getting into the best shape of my life, learning about cyber security, embarking upon and / or organizing food tours, writing a cookbook, and executing projects to help humanity.

I love to code. It’s a creative outlet for left and right brained thinking. I also love translating technical concepts into non-technical language.

I'm seeking freelance work anywhere in the world, and full-time positions as a software engineer, developer, project manager, product manager, solutions architect, or technology consultant.

Feel free to take a look around. I'll be adding more here in the coming days and weeks, looking forward to collaborating with others as I grow as well!
