About Me: Creative and logical thinking;  an extensive background in administration, project management; an understanding of  entrepreneurship; myriad eclectic interests.

I love to code. Itâ€™s a creative outlet for left and right brained thinking. I also love translating technical concepts into non-technical language.

I'm seeking freelance work anywhere in the world, a full-time position as a software engineer, developer, project manager, product manager, solutions architect, or technology consultant.

Welcome!
